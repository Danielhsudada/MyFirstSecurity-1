### 安裝在Docker環境:Download and install as a docker container
```
dockerhub page :https://hub.docker.com/r/vulnerables/web-dvwa/


docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa

Please ensure you are using aufs due to previous MySQL issues. 

Run docker info to check your storage driver. If it isn't aufs, please change it as such. 

There are guides for each operating system on how to do that, but they're quite different so we won't cover that here.
